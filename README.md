# TIC TAC TOE

Try out this cute TIC TAC TOE game.  
The game can be played by two players taking turn to position their markers inside a grid of 9 cells.
Or you can test your skills by playing against the computer. Let's see if you can bit it.  
The project is simple but lay down a solid structure for a more complex web app.  
It is part of [microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) curriculum.
